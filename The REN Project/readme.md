UB Darknode Staking Pool 
We would love for you to investigate creating a REN Staking pool. The minimum bond to run a Ren Darknode is 100,000 REN. The pool would would allow REN holders to join their REN together, and bond it to a Ren node that Foundry will operate.

Someone thinking about the same thing: https://forum.renproject.io/t/ren-darknode-pool/433
This can be simplified a lot, because we can remove the governance and simply have users enter into SLAs or contracts with Foundry to manage withdrawls, payouts, etc.

Additionally, ETH is no longer needed for claiming Darknode rewards.

Challenges: I forsee testing as being difficult, as I believe there are limited REN testtnet resources.

Ask:

Please return to us next week with an answer as to if you believe this is possible and a plan to achieve this end.

Iâ€™ve been putting together some design ideas for a REN Darknode Pool, similar to a Yearn VAULT and managed via a DAO.
