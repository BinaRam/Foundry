# The AirNode Research

- AirNode project plan 

This project is about oraclizing APIs so that smart contracts can find consistent responses/data/answers.
In this case, the API we are planning to oraclize is an unusual one: that of Google Vision API.

The goal is to support smart contracts in decision making about a given image, whether it is acceptable for, say, public release.

The project will be developed in 6 phases.

- AirNode/API3 basic concept
