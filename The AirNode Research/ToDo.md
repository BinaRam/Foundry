# To do list

## Remix interaction
Decided to do part with CLI  and actual interaction with Remix @address deployment
- Done --@swetha

## Figure out the three types of client example
Regular request, short request and full request
- Regular request has all paramters, short request -- the template id, full request -- has template id + overiding parameters.

## Concerns about airnode startup: 
Fulfillment is taking anywhere from 2-40+ miniutes!!
- It seems to be okay now-- May be Akhil's set up issue.

## Docker deploy of AirNode in preparation for Google Vision API interface
- Swetha is working on it.
- AirNode deployment is taking a long time; sometimes it fails after long delay.
